== Example Spring Boot Restful Microservice

https://git.delta.com/openshift/application-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-rest-example[This] is an example Spring Boot application that will deploy to
OpenShift. The application includes https://git.delta.com/openshift/application-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-rest-example/.openshift/templates[build and deploy configs] and Ansible
https://git.delta.com/openshift/application-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-rest-example/.applier[applier] configuration.


== Quickstart: Automated Deployment

This Quickstart will build and deploy the sample application on the OpenShift
platform.

**Prerequisites**

You will need the following before you can deploy the sample application to
OpenShift:

* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[OpenShift CLI]
* https://paasport.delta.com/docs/#on-boarding[Access OpenShift NameSpace]


Starting from your local machine, you will complete the following steps. This
will run applier on OpenShift and deploy the sample application. You can also
follow along with this https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/42d2f24c-27be-4130-bbc8-05262b710f02?list=studio[tutorial video].


1) Login to https://sbx2con.paasdev.delta.com/console[OpenShift Console] from
a browser.

2) Click on your username and copy the login command to your clipboard.

image::/openjdk/spring-boot-rest-example/images/openshift_login.png[1000,1000]

3) Paste login command in your terminal and login to OpenShift again from the
terminal.

----
oc login ...
----

4) Start the toolbox container and login to OpenShift from its terminal.
----
oc run -i -t tool-box-example --image=quay.io/redhat-cop/tool-box:v1.2 --restart=Never --rm bash
----

then

----
oc login ...
----

5) Copy your application-examples repo to the container.
----
git clone https://git.delta.com/openshift/application-examples.git
----

6) Navigate to the SpringBoot Rest Example project.
----
cd application-examples/openjdk/spring-boot-rest-example
----

7) Deploy the sample app
----
./deploy.sh <your-namespace>
----

Congratulations you have just deployed to OpenShift!

By clicking on your project in the OpenShift console you should see your three
containers running in pod.

== Deeper Dive

This section is optional. If you have followed the instructions in the Quickstart
then you have already deployed an application to OpenShift. This section goes
into the details of OpenShift and Applier.

=== Openshift Components

The `.openshift` folder will contain all the resources for building and
deploying your application on Openshift. In this example three containers will
be created. The toolbox container will give an interactive command line to run
OpenShift commands. The Jenkins container will build your application and deploy
it via pipeline to the third container.

=== Build Config

A build is defined by a *BuildConfig*. This is a REST object that
can be used in a HTTP POST request to the OpenShift API to create a new instance of a Jenkins
server that contains a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline will be used to build test
deploy the sample applications.

The build config template is located at
`.openshift/templates/build.yml`. We want to keep the build config
template generic and use parameters to compose the BuildConfig at runtime. The
param
file that is used to build the application in the sandbox (sbx) environment is
located at `.openshift/params/build-sbx`.

=== Deploy Config

A deployment is defined by a *DeployConfig*. This is a REST object that can be
used in a HTTP POST request to deploy an application to openshift. There are 4 key
components to the DeployConfig:

1. A replication controller template which describes the application to be deployed.
2. The default replica count for the deployment.
3. A deployment strategy which will be used to execute the deployment.
4. A set of triggers which cause deployments to be created automatically.

The Deploy Config is located at `.openshift/templates/deploy.yml`. We
want to keep the deploy config as generic as possible. All the params
for the `deploy.yml` are located at `.openshift/params/deploy-sbx`.

=== Git Secrets

The Git Secrets contains information that the Jenkins pipeline will you to checkout
source code from git hub. The key component here is the
https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh[SSH Key Pair]. You will need to generate a
SSH Key-Pair. You will add the private key to your gitsecrets file.
The public key will be added to your GitLab account.

=== Route Config

The Route config has 3 components. The application name is self explanitory. The
*_namespace_* is the name of your project in OpenShift. The hostname is the
external address of your project.


== Applier Components

The applier uses https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works[ansible] to
set everything up for you in OpenShift. The .applier folder contains all the
resources needed for the applier to automatically apply your OpenShift
configuration. This includes provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications,
and networking.

=== Inventory and Hosts

The *_inventory_* directory lists all of the systems that the applier will work
with via Ansible.

The hosts file lists all of the host groups and hosts that the applier will work
with via Ansible. The hosts file will be generated dynamically using
the *_seed-hosts_* file in the *_group_vars_* directory. The *_seed-hosts.yml_*.
Uses templates and parameters from the *_.openshift_* directory to do this
automatically.

=== Group Vars

The *_group_vars_* folder will contain a *_seed-hosts.yml_* file which
will contain the Ansible tasks to run all the templates with params.

=== Requirements

The *_requirements.yml_* will install the ansible roles on your OpenShift infrastructure.
How this works is outside the scope of this example, but if you are curious you
can find out more https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier[here].


== Build and run the example app locally

This section is optional. The sample application uses the SpringBoot frame work to bootstrap a java
application. This example can be used as the boiler-plate code for a Java, Spring,
or SpringBoot application. This section will show you how to run the sample
application on your local for machine. Click http://spring.io/guides[here] to dive deeper into SpringBoot

*Prerequisites*

To run the project locally you will need the following installed on your workstation:

* https://deltasn.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=f6f7ab5cdb85930432e9f7441d961908[Java version 8 or higher]
* https://gradle.org/install/[Gradle 4.4.1 or higher]
* https://deltasn.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=d2a723d4db85930432e9f7441d961901[Git]
